## Summary of idea

* Make it easier to plan dates with matches met on our site by being able to send the match a date and each user can review and change information on the date.  You can check on available events for the desired day, check on available restaurants, etc.

* What problem or pain point does it solve?
  1. Being able to plan a date that you know both partys will enjoy.  
  2. Not being able to know if your date will like what you have planned.
  3. Makes planning a date fun by doing it together.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition

What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day? To display event information based on data input by the user
